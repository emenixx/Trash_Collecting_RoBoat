# Project : Trash-collecting Ro-Boat

## Project description

The purpose of this project is to build a prototype of a boat that collects trash floating at the surface of a lake.
It was done using the SKIL and SPOT makerspaces at EPFL.

## Project structure

- "*Codes*" contains program codes;
- "*Objects*" contains 3D and 2D models;
- "*Documentation*" contains illustrations.

- "*Report...*" ...

### Files in *Codes*

- "*RC_to_STEP.ino*" is the code compiled on Arduino Nanos;
- "*Submerged_Volume_Estimation*" is a code that estimates how much floater volume is submerged depending on the total mass of the prototype.

### Files in *Objects*

- "*BAG_clip_L.step*" is a 3D model of the clip used to install our mesh bag, left version;
- "*BAG_clip_L.step*" is a 3D model of the other clip used to install our mesh bag, right version;
- "*GEAR_conveyor-belt.step*" is a 3D model of the gear that makes the conveyor belt run;
- "*MOTOR_box_conveyor-belt.dxf*" is a 2D model of the box covering the motor of the conveyor belt, protecting it from splashes and fixing it on the prototype;
- "*MOTOR_box_paddle-wheel.dxf*" is a 2D model of the box covering the motor of the paddle wheel, protecting it from splashes and fixing it on the prototype;
